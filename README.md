Our vision for this Android application is to enhance the Student News service at Calvin college. Student News, while informative, is quite dry in terms of a user interface and paltry in terms of features. We are setting out to change that. We envision a Pinterest-style application that presents the Student News to Calvin students in an interesting way. We also wish to add features to this application that enable students to take control of what they want to see. You don't want to see the articles about semester trips? No problem! A filter will help you include whatever you want to see and exclude what you don't. This app puts you in control of Calvin's Student News.
